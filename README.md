# JATE-Just A Text Editor
     
## Description
The text editor  is a useful application because, much like the Notes app on your cellphone or a word processor on your laptop, people will always have a need to write things down without always having the means to do so. This app allows users to take that note-taking skill with them anywhere anytime.

The PWA is an important facet of full stack development because so much of what consumers will pay for and use today is application-based. Having a PWA that can be installed and run locally or on a mobile device is an important skill to hone.
